Our App plan

Please outline: 
●	Target audience
●	What the app should do
●	Any additional features that could be added on



Concept #1:		Parenting ‘Reward Chart’ App

This app is designed to work like a gold star chart for children. Considering that most children nowadays have access to iPhones and iPads, this one would play on the competitiveness that we have ingrained into our minds from a young age. Time after time, I see kids becoming more interested in something if they are competing with their siblings or classmates. This app would give a stimulus like a game where goals are achieved with completed tasks set by the parent. The final idea is to have the app cloud based where the parent will setup a free account and setup their kids where they can control the tasks and check them off once completed.

Concept #2:		Fuel Tracker
Simple program to keep track of your fuel consumption for your car. When filling up, type in the kilometers and it will work out an average. It will need some dedication from the user to control filling up around the same time. Also type in the different types of octane grade used and it can keep track of consumption on that level too.



Concept #3:		Compression Algorithm
Simple to do, invent an algorithm that can compress files to a 500000000th of their size while leaving it completely lossless. lol



Concept #4:		Create your own Solar System
Using monkeys, shoot bananas into space to create a solar system! Quirky graphics and gameplay, simple GUI.
